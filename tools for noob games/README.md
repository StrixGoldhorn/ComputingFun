# compilation of trash games + trash tools  

some tools for: trash web-based games, usually those made by amateurs so they're insanely inefficient which gives motivation to make random tools to make requests to the server.

games shall not be named because they do not deserve the fame, and to save others from the trash it is. also so the game's creators and players can't find this.
